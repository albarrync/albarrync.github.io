Just a quick blog post to spread the good word. Consider -

`The unexamined editor is not worth integrating`

I'm a big proponent of neovim, and I recently got a few plugins configured, and I don't think there is any way I could work without them now.

* Copilot  ** AI Pair & Autocomplete Bot
* Mason    ** LSP Manager
* Luasnip  ** Custom Snippets
* Nvim-Cmp ** Autocomplete Menu

All setup can be found in my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/albarrync/dotfiles)
